# CSE6705-Final-0422052103
In this project, I tried to implement a meta heuristic based solution for feature selection. For this task, I used Spotted Hyena Optimization(SHO) algorithm along with K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm. I used 4 standard dataset from UCI repository, they are : Heart, Hepatitis, Tic-Tac-Toe and Zoo. I used the mealpy library for implementation.
